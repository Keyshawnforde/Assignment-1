        <h1>Projects and Assignments</h1>
<body align="center">
    The assignments I've done so far would be this one right now, and also I've done 1 lab for my computer security class. The last assignments/projects I had that utilized Python would be Object Oriented Programming. In that assignment, we would have to use our knowledge of python to create different functions that would be user friendly towards the person who is using said program. Other assignments I've worked on would be for my business elective courses.
